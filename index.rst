Gentoo Policy Guide
===================
Gentoo Policy Guide aims to become a definitive clear source of all
Tree Policies that are currently binding to Gentoo developers.
It combines both policies that are global by design (i.e. set by the QA
team or the Council), as well as specific to other Gentoo projects.
The policies are meant to be supplied with rationale and clear
indication of the body setting the policy, and therefore the process
in which the policy can be updated.
